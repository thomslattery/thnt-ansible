# THOMnottom Ansible Configuration

My attempt to build an Ansible configuration to easily rebuild my systems. Maybe even offer advice to others.

This first attempt is comprised of separate files to handle each need.

 - detenv.yml - some environmental configs
 - autofs.yml - install all requirements and copy over configs for NFS connections
 - vscode.yml - install vs code
